<b>
    <p> Football also called Soccer is a game in which two teams of 11 players, <br>
        using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to move or <br>
        in other words dribble, pass, or shoot the ball into the opposing teams goal. <br>
        Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within <br>
        the penalty area surrounding the goal. The team that scores more goals wins. <br>
        This is my favourite sport. This is the sport I have played the most and I <br>
        recommended the most but it does require stamna since there is alot of running.
