    <p> 
        Volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, <br>
        in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a <br>
        high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents <br>
        playing area before it can be returned. To prevent this a player on the <br>
        opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the <br>
        court surfaceâ€”that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat <br>
        it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net. A team is allowed only <br>
        three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.
